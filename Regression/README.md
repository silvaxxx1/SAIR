## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

| Lecture       | Content                        | Key Skills                                                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lecture 1** | Linear Regression Fundamentals | Linear models, gradient descent, basic metrics                |
| **Lecture 2** | Advanced Regression            | Feature scaling, polynomial regression, regularization        |
| **Lecture 3** | Model Evaluation & Deployment  | MLflow, cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, Streamlit UI |

* **Resources/** → Extra readings for deeper understanding
* **app.py & app_2.py** → Reference UIs for deployment
* **utils.py & utils2.py** → Reusable preprocessing & feature engineering code

---

## 🧪 Experiments & Models

* All experiments are tracked with **MLflow** for reproducibility.
* Trained models are stored in the `models/` directory.
* Experiment logs, hyperparameters, and metrics are saved under `experiments/`.

---

## 🏁 Student Capstone Projects

Complete a **Regression Capstone Project**:

* ✅ Dataset of your choice (public or self-collected)
* ✅ Jupyter notebook with preprocessing, model training, and evaluation
* ✅ Streamlit app (`app.py`) for interactive UI
* ✅ Any additional `utils.py` or assets
* ✅ Short `README.md` explaining your project

**Required Folder Structure:**

```
Regression/Regression Capstone Projects/
└── YourProjectName/
    ├── notebook.ipynb
    ├── app.py
    ├── utils.py           (if needed)
    ├── data/              (your dataset)
    ├── models/            (trained model)
    ├── experiments/       (MLflow logs)
    └── README.md          (project description)
```

> Name your folder clearly using your project or dataset name. Keep datasets small or link externally.

---

## 📤 Upload Your Project to GitHub

1. **Fork SAIR Repository**: [https://github.com/silvaxxx1/SAIR](https://github.com/silvaxxx1/SAIR)
2. **Clone Your Fork**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/SAIR.git
cd SAIR/Regression/Regression\ Capstone\ Projects
```

3. **Add Your Project Folder** inside `Regression Capstone Projects`
4. **Commit & Push**:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add My Regression Capstone Project"
git push origin main
```

5. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)** on GitHub

---

## 🖥️ Running Your Streamlit App

Test your UI locally:

```bash
uv run streamlit run app.py
# or
streamlit run app.py
```

Inside your project folder:

```bash
cd Regression/Regression\ Capstone\ Projects/YourProjectName
uv run streamlit run app.py
# or
streamlit run app.py
```

App will launch at 👉 [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

> `uv run` ensures your Python environment from `uv` is used.

## 🏆 Tips for a Great Capstone

* Clean, well-documented code 🧼
* Clear explanation of data & problem statement
* Visualizations (matplotlib, seaborn, plotly) 📊
* Log experiments with MLflow
* Simple and interactive Streamlit UI
* Include `README.md` with:

  * Project title
  * Dataset description
  * Model used
  * How to run app
  * Results and observations
