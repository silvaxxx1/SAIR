## ⚡ Quick Start Guide

### **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.11 or higher
- Git
- A terminal/command line interface
- A code editor (VS Code, PyCharm, or your preference)

### **1️⃣ Installation with `uv` (Recommended)**

We use `uv` for fast, reliable Python dependency management. If you don't have it installed, get it from [astral.sh/uv](https://astral.sh/uv).

**Step 1: Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/silvaxxx1/SAIR.git
cd SAIR
```

**Step 2: Install Dependencies**
```bash
uv sync
```

This command reads `pyproject.toml` and installs all required packages in an isolated environment.

## 🎓 Current Course: Regression

Welcome to the **Regression** module—your first step into machine learning!

### **What You'll Learn**

This course covers regression fundamentals through hands-on projects:

- **Lecture 1:** Introduction to linear regression, cost functions, and optimization

1. **Lecture_1.ipynb** – Linear Regression Fundamentals
   - What is regression?
   - Cost functions and gradient descent
   - Implementation from scratch
   - Exercises: Build a simple linear model

2. **Lecture_2.ipynb** – Practical Regression Techniques
   - Polynomial regression
   - Regularization (L1/L2)
   - Feature scaling and normalization
   - Exercises: Multi-feature regression
   - use scikit-learn for implementations
   - build simple UI with Gradio

3. **Lecture_3.ipynb** – Advanced Regression & Deployment
   - mlflow for experiment tracking and reproduction
   - Train/test/validation splits
   - Cross-validation
   - using more advanced models (Gradient Boost, Random Forests , ensemble methods)

#### 💼 **Resources** (`Resources/` folder)

Additional materials for deeper understanding:
- Research papers on regression methods
- Best practices guides
- Cheat sheets for common algorithms
- Links to external courses and tutorials

#### 🛠️ **Live Application: Streamlit App**

See regression in action with an interactive web app!

**What it does:**
- Trains a regression model on California housing data
- Allows you to make predictions with custom inputs
- Visualizes the model's performance
- Shows feature importance

**How to run it:**
```bash
uv run streamlit run Regression/app.py
```

The app will open at `http://localhost:8501`. Play around, make predictions, and see how the model responds!

## 💻 Development Notes

### **Using `uv` for Package Management**

If you need to add new dependencies:

```bash
uv add package_name
```

This automatically updates `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`.

### **Running Scripts**

```bash
# Run a Python script with the managed environment
uv run python script_name.py

# Or activate the environment shell
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

### **Alternative: Using `requirements.txt`**

If you prefer traditional pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
